# vue-todo

This is a VueJS project that connects with RethinkDB with Socket.io
I'm still learning this stuff so let me know if anything is wrong.

Currently working on removing Bulma, adding user authentication and cleaning up the current code.

Also working on a tutorial for this on my site : <a href="http://patrickbollenbach.com/blog">www.patrickbollenbach.com</a>


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run rethinkdb
rethinkdb

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
